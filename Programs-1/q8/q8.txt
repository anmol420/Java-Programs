Write a program to accept a set of n integers (where n > 0) in a single
dimensional array. Arrange the elements of the array such that the lowest number
appears in the centre of the array, next lower number in the right cell of the
centre, next lower in the left cell of the centre and so on... . The process will stop when the highest number will set in its appropriate cell. Finally, display the
array elements.

Assume that the memory space is less. Hence, you don't need to create extra
array for the aforesaid task.

Example:

Input: 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 5 3 1 2 4

Input: 11 12 31 14 5
Output: 31 12 5 11 14

Given two positive numbers M and N, such that M is between 100 and 10000
and N is less than 100. Find the smallest integer that is greater than M and
whose digits add up to N. For example, if M = 100 and N = 11, then the smallest
integer greater than 100 whose digits add up to 11 is 119.

Write a program to accept the numbers M and N from the user and print the
smallest required number whose sum of the digits is equal to N. Also, print the
total number of digits present in the required number. The program should check
for the validity of the inputs and display an appropriate message for an invalid
input. Test your program with the sample data and some random data:

> Example 1 

Input:
M = 100
N = 11

Output:
The required number = 119
Total number of digits = 3

> Example 2

Input:
M = 112
N = 130

Output:
Invalid Input

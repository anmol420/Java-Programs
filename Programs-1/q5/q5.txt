A number is said to Bouncy number if the digits of the number are unsorted.

For example,
22344 - It is not a Bouncy number because the digits are sorted in ascending
order.
774410 - It is not a Bouncy number because the digits are sorted in
descending order.
155349 - It is a Bouncy number because the digits are unsorted.
A number below 100 can never be a Bouncy number.

Write a program in java to accept a number. Check and display whether it is a
Bouncy number or not.

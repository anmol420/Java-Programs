A triangular number is formed by the addition of consecutive integers starting
with 1. For example,

1 + 2 = 3
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

thus, 3, 6, 10, 15, are triangular numbers.

Write a program in Java to display all the triangular numbers from 3 to n, taking
the value of n as an input.

Write a Program in Java to input a number and check whether it is a Fascinating
Number or not.

Fascinating Numbers: Some numbers of 3 digits or more exhibit a very interesting
property. The property is such that, when the number is multiplied by 2 and 3,
and both these products are concatenated with the original number, all digits from
1 to 9 are present exactly once, regardless of the number of zeroes.

Let's understand the concept of Fascinating Number through the following example:

Consider the number 192
192 x 1 = 192
192 x 2 = 384
192 x 3 = 576
Concatenating the results: 192 384 576

It could be observed that '192384576' consists of all digits from 1 to 9 exactly
once. Hence, it could be concluded that 192 is a Fascinating Number. Some
3

examples of fascinating Numbers are: 192, 219, 273, 327, 1902, 1920, 2019
etc.
